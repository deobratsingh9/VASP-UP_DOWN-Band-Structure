# VASP-UP_DOWN-Band-Structure
How to  calculate and analyze spin-polarized electronic structures with VASP code.  We will go through: Input files setup (INCAR, POSCAR..), Plotting spin-up (↑) &amp; spin-down (↓) channels electronic band structures, Visualizing Projected Density of States (PDOS),Combining Spin-Polarized Band structure + DOS for clear insights into layered materials
